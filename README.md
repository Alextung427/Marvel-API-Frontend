# Marvel-API-Frontend
This is my frontend code to using Marvel API to showcase characters from Marvel. 
I used React framework to code with NODE.js

I have installed quite a few dependancies some of them are
npm i axios
npm i history
npm i react-loading
npm i bootstrap
npm i sass
npm i react-router-dom
